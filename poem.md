#Fancy's Fool
 
    "Cornel, cornel, green and white,
    Spreading on the forest floor,
    Whither went my lost delight
    Through the silent door?"

    "Mortal, mortal, overfond,
    How come you at all to know
    There be any joys beyond
    Blisses here and now?"

    "Cornel, cornel, white and cool,
    Many a mortal, I've heard tell,
    Who is only Fancy's fool
    Knows that secret well."

    "Mortal, mortal, what would you
    With that beauty once was yours?
    Perishable is the dew,
    And the dust endures."

    "Cornel, cornel, pierce me not
    With your sweet, reserved disdain!
    Whisper me of things forgot
    That shall be again."

    "Mortal, we are kinsmen, led
    By a hope beyond our reach.
    Know you not the word unsaid
    Is the flower of speech?"

    All the snowy blossoms faded,
    While the scarlet berries grew;
    And all summer they evaded
    Anything they knew.

    "Cornel, cornel, green and red
    Flooring for the forest wide,
    Whither down the ways of dread
    Went my starry-eyed?"

    "Mortal, mortal, is there found
    Any fruitage half so fair
    In the dim world underground
    As there grows in air?"

    "Wilding cornel, you can guess
    Nothing of eternal pain,
    Growing there in quietness
    In the sun and rain."

    "Mortal, where your heart would be
    Not a wanderer may go,
    But he shares the dark with me
    Underneath the snow."

    And the scarlet berries scattered
    With the coming on of fall;
    Not to one of them it mattered
    Anything at all.
